# API with Node.js + PostgreSQL + TypeORM
this is a simple nodejs / express project with a basic implementation for many ideas 

## how to clone this project
```
git clone https://github.com/AliFSaleh/Posts-Management.git
npm install
cp .env.example .env
```

## Covered ideas:
- Initialize TypeORM
- Connecting with PostgreSQL
- JWT Authentication / User Login and Register Flow with JWT Authentication
- Using Zod Schemas to Validate Request Body
- Error Handling
- Authentication routes and middleware
- Using Pug Templating Engine
- Send mials with Nodemailer
- Upload Single Image With Multer
- Integration with stripe

## to send mail
- when user register a new email we will send an email to verify this account so you should define the .env params:
```
EMAIL_USER=
EMAIL_PASS=
EMAIL_HOST=
EMAIL_PORT=
```

## Project flow:
- when user register a new email we will send an email to verify this account so don't forget to create your .env from the .env.example and define the .env params:
- the email is provided with a link generated by the app to verify your so you just need to click on the link and your account will be verified
- if you don't verify your account you will be not able to subscribe a package to share posts with others
- so to add a new post you want to select a package which and subscribe it, when you do that you will be able to share your ideas until you subscription date is ended
- there is:
  - /create-checkout-session
  - /webhook
- for integration with stripe, we used here payment mode so the first route will create to you payment session and return the payment link and the second route will call by stripe when the payment is done to create the subscription info in the database so you should not forget the STRIPE_SECRET before using this routes
